# PyPost
Graph and post process simulator data

For now this program is intended to be a replacement for Nutmeg,
which is the post processor for data created by NGSpice and other circuit simulators.
The advantage of this program is that it uses Qt and does not require X-Windows.
It is written in Python and uses matplotlib.
A Python REPL loop is the expression evaluator.
