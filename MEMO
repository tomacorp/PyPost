ngspice -r ngtest.raw -b ngtest.cki
pip install fysom
pip install cx_freeze

Tried
cxfreeze MainWindow.py --target-dir dist
but this errored out 
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/Users/toma/Library/Enthought/Canopy_64bit/User/lib/Python'

There is a python in
/Users/toma/Library/Enthought/Canopy_64bit/User/bin

Put cx_freeze in other python:
/Users/toma/python278i/bin
pip install cx_Freeze
